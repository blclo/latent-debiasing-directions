# Latent De-biasing Directions

This repository is dedicated to the development and presentation of methods for de-biasing in latent spaces, particularly aimed at improving fairness in machine learning models. The project is structured to facilitate easy understanding and application of the proposed methods, making it suitable for both academic research and practical implementations.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To use the de-biasing methods presented in this repository, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the `src` directory.
2. Run the desired script using Python. For example, `python example_script.py`.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains the Python source code files for the de-biasing methods.
- `tests/`: Houses unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the code.
